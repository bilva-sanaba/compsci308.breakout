Impressions: This was by far my favorite assignment at Duke so far. I thoroughly enjoyed coding and seeing a product like this. Unfortunately I am only now realizing how much more I would have had to have done to create a better designed project. I feel like I did not

know how to do much design wise. By the time we discussed ideas such as avoidance of static instance variables or single function per method, I had done too much to easily change my project. Despite spending many hours refactoring, I felt as if there was nothing I could do other than start over. I hope in the future this project will have a little more guidance before being assigned so that students will not do things similar to 201 and end up with working code that they simply cannot redesign well in a small amount of time. That being said, looking back at the project, if I had spent a lot more time just thinking about design rather than coding or seeing, I probably would have ended up with something I was much more proud of.
