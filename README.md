## Get Started
Program is run through the main class, and no other classes contain main. 


## Resource Files
The positions of all blocks per level are stored in a resource file called Levels. The file format is simple to understand and changing the Level file allows for different games to be played.

* Player 1 can move with the left and right arrows
* Player 2 can move with the A and D keys
* Score is determined by number of blocks hit, powerups received, and by scoring goals into the other player's net.
* The winner is determined by score if the end of the game is reached, or, if 10 goals are allowed by one player, then the other player wins.
