This is the first project of CS308 at Duke. 

For it I created a version of Breakout, that is soccer themed. 

1/16-1/23/2017  

Approximately 30 Hours

Files Required: Levels

The game is a two player version of breakout with player 1 controlling motion with left and right arrows while player two uses a and d.
There are limited lives, 3 levels, and points assigned for hitting a block or scoring a goal. Cheat codes include: L for extra lives,
C to stay on a level after all blocks are cleared, 1,2,3 to go to that level. N to go to the next level. P to pause and Space to start. 

Known Problems: 

Ball detection with paddle sides when paddle is moving is not fully functional. 
Two players moving at same time may be slower. 

Features: 

Powerups - Extra ball, extra points, larger paddle

Paddle- warp sides, ball changes direction differently depending on where it hits the paddle,paddle can increase size. 

Blocks - 1,2, 3 hits, or indestructible

Two Player


Design Issues: 

Many more abstractions could have been used and all of the main class should have been moved elsewhere.
